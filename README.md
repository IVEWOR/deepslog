[12/04/22] So, I guess I need a personal portfolio website after all these years. After working for 5+ years as full stack I've zero web presence. So, this is to start something towards my personal branding.

Also, if anyone especially a dev or designer and looking to build their portfolio website. You can use this repo without asking me and don't need to provide any credit to me at all but a DM would be great only if this helped you.

## Project details

This web app is going to be on Django (Python). You can use downlaod this repo on your local machine and change as per your needs.

### The goal

- The goal of this website to build my online presence and get some gigs if possible and overkill this tiny site by integrating big enterprises features and technologies. 

- I'd probably use Kubernetes later on whenever I figure out the cost part.

### Features or things
- Normal static pages as usual.
- A blog with categories selection.
- AWS S3 settings and CloudFront setup will be done, just change them your credientials.
- AWS CloudFormation for image optimization (Only if I able to write deep case studies).
- Untill, above. I'll be integrated Sorl-Thumbnail which will optimize the images and store and them on S3.
- Going to use a Docker container. 
- Django test-driven project.
- More Coming Soon!!!
