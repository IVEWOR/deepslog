MerBart is a Norway-based sticker brand that needed more than just a fresh coat of paint — they needed a complete performance overhaul, a UI/UX redesign, and a developer who could solve real technical bottlenecks affecting both user experience and business operations.

## Project Goals

- Redesign the site’s UI and improve UX flow across all devices
- Optimize performance and page load speeds
- Implement brand-aligned color schemes and interactivity
- Solve order processing slowdowns caused by 3rd-party plugins
- Migrate from traditional hosting to a modern cloud environment
- Improve SEO and on-page optimization
