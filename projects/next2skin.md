Next2Skin is a large-scale fashion and accessories brand based in India, with a wide product catalog and an expanding customer base. They needed a fully custom-built WooCommerce store — lightweight, fast, and designed to scale with their growth. I was responsible for delivering the entire website from the ground up.

## Objectives

- Build a custom WooCommerce site with full control over design and performance  
- Create all core pages: homepage, product page, category/archive pages, contact page  
- Integrate a reliable payment gateway  
- Develop lightweight, fast-loading templates with optimized assets  
- Build sliders and static sections including a branded lookbook  
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness and clean UX across devices

## Approach

I developed the website using a fully custom WordPress theme, designed specifically to keep things fast, lightweight, and flexible for ongoing updates. WooCommerce was seamlessly integrated, and I tailored every template — from product displays to category pages — to match the brand’s vision.

A custom homepage layout was created to feature products and promotional content without sacrificing speed. I built a branded lookbook section to support visual storytelling and enhance the shopping experience. All static pages were designed with a focus on clean structure, responsive layout, and consistent branding.

On the technical side, I optimized CSS and JS delivery, reduced server load, and integrated a payment gateway with secure and stable handling for Indian e-commerce.

## Results

- Fully customized, lightweight WooCommerce store  
- Seamless payment gateway integration for smooth checkout flow  
- Optimized performance with fast load times across all pages  
- Complete control over content and layout for the brand’s team  
- Modern, responsive design with a cohesive visual system from homepage to lookbook

The result was a clean, professional, high-converting WooCommerce storefront — built from scratch, performance-tuned, and future-ready.
