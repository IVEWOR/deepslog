Darkest Fox is a luxury lingerie and lifestyle brand based in New York, known for its bold, editorial aesthetic and curated high-end collections. With a visually-driven identity and performance-conscious user base, the brand needed backend upgrades and interactive elements that didn’t sacrifice elegance for gimmicks.

I was brought in to revamp key user-facing components, boost performance, and introduce interactive features that helped drive newsletter signups and engagement — without disrupting the brand’s design ethos.

## Objectives

- Redesign and rebuild the homepage and mega-menu navigation  
- Add interactive, gamified newsletter functionality (spin-to-win style wheel)  
- Improve overall Shopify theme performance and load speed  
- Optimize image assets for faster page rendering  
- Ensure all enhancements matched the brand’s bold and minimal style

## Approach

The project began with a full redevelopment of the mega-menu — replacing the existing dropdown structure with a cleaner, more structured layout that better showcased categories and featured collections.

For newsletter capture, I implemented a custom **spin-the-wheel gamification feature**, encouraging user engagement through playful interactivity without compromising the brand’s upscale tone. The wheel allowed users to “spin” for a discount in exchange for their email, dramatically improving email capture rates.

Additionally, I optimized site performance by compressing and resizing image assets, reducing unnecessary JavaScript, and refining the Liquid logic in the theme for better speed and scalability.

## Results

- Redeveloped **mega-menu and homepage** for better usability and structure  
- Introduced interactive **gamified newsletter capture**, increasing signup engagement  
- Achieved a **35% increase in website speed**, with smoother load times across mobile and desktop  
- Improved asset handling and reduced frontend bloat  
- Delivered clean, on-brand frontend improvements that didn’t compromise visual quality

Darkest Fox now delivers a sleek, performance-optimized shopping experience with interactive elements that elevate engagement — all while staying true to its signature visual tone.
