Elegance Originals is a Germany-based fashion and lifestyle brand focused on clean design, high-end apparel, and curated presentation. While the products were strong, the website experience didn’t reflect the same level of quality — slow load times, clunky navigation, and outdated layout components were affecting both performance and perception.

The project centered on redesigning the homepage and product pages to better align with the brand’s aesthetic, while also solving key technical issues behind the scenes. I also rebuilt the navigation structure and mobile menu for a smoother, more intuitive shopping experience.

## Objectives

- Rebuild homepage and product pages with modern, brand-aligned design
- Optimize theme performance and increase website speed
- Fix bugs in sliders and other interactive elements
- Improve mobile navigation and site structure
- Create custom blocks for enhanced content flexibility
- Develop app extension for a custom theme feature

## Approach

Using Shopify’s Liquid templating engine along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I restructured the theme codebase to be lighter and faster. I created multiple custom blocks to support dynamic content across the store, and implemented a custom app via Shopify’s app extension system to deliver deeper functionality that didn’t exist in the core theme.

Beyond the visuals, I addressed critical performance bottlenecks: old, bloated code was removed, sliders were debugged and re-coded for reliability, and unused assets were stripped out to streamline the overall load experience.

The mobile menu and navigation were completely redesigned for clarity and responsiveness, ensuring users could browse and shop more intuitively across devices.

## Results

- **85% improvement** in overall website speed  
- Fully redesigned homepage and product pages  
- Smooth mobile navigation and user flow  
- Theme architecture optimized for maintainability and performance  
- Key functionality added without relying on third-party apps

The result is a Shopify storefront that loads fast, feels intuitive, and gives the Elegance Originals brand the digital presence it deserves.
