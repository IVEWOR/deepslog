Capes Sokol is a high-profile law firm with a large-scale, content-rich website. When I joined the project, the site was suffering from performance issues, scattered design elements, and inefficiencies in content management — all while running on Beaver Builder, which had to be preserved for static page editing by their internal team.

My role was to improve both performance and maintainability while following strict brand and design guidelines across all pages.

## Objectives

- Improve overall website performance and Google PageSpeed scores  
- Standardize design and layout for consistency across all pages  
- Create custom templates for dynamic content while preserving Beaver Builder for static sections  
- Reduce layout shifts and slow load times on mobile  
- Implement dynamic content fields using MetaBox for editorial flexibility  
- Rebuild the navigation bar and improve site-wide UX

## Approach

Working within the existing Beaver Builder framework, I created custom static pages where appropriate, while building dynamic content sections using PHP-based templates powered by MetaBox. This hybrid approach allowed content editors to maintain control over key pages without sacrificing structure or performance.

To support the site’s heavy content demands, I implemented a set of custom fields and dynamic layouts for attorney profiles, practice areas, resources, and firm news — all designed to pull structured content cleanly and present it with a unified visual language.

Significant performance optimization was carried out:
- Google PageSpeed score increased from **49 to 84**  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** reduced from **2.8 to 0**  
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** improved from **5.28s to 300ms**  
- Critical CSS and asset loading optimized, image handling streamlined

Additionally, I redesigned and rebuilt the global navigation to improve accessibility, clarity, and responsiveness across devices.

## Results

- Major performance boost across desktop and mobile  
- Fully rebuilt navigation and improved overall user flow  
- Unified visual design across dozens of static and dynamic pages  
- Custom templates and MetaBox integration streamlined editorial workflow  
- Content-heavy pages now load smoothly with minimal layout shifts

This was a deep dive into enterprise WordPress development — where performance, design consistency, and editorial flexibility had to coexist. Mission accomplished.
