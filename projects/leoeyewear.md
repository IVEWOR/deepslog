LEO Eyewear is a modern eyewear brand focused on stylish, accessible optical and sunglasses. In 2020, I was brought on to build their entire Shopify storefront from scratch — everything from layout and design implementation to full product catalog structure and frontend responsiveness.

## Objectives

- Build a fully custom Shopify storefront from the ground up  
- Deliver a clean, modern, mobile-first experience that reflects the brand’s minimalist aesthetic  
- Create layouts for homepage, collection, product pages, and supporting brand pages  
- Ensure scalability for future collections and seasonal updates  
- Optimize theme for performance and maintainability

## Approach

Starting with a clean base theme, I developed every page using Shopify’s Liquid templating system, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The design was built to be responsive and visually consistent across all devices, with a focus on usability and conversion.

I created custom sections and blocks for Shopify’s theme editor to give the brand full control over content without requiring ongoing development. The homepage, collection pages, and product templates were tailored for easy navigation, clean visual hierarchy, and fast browsing.

From footer to header, every element of the store was developed to reflect the brand’s modern, minimal identity.

## Results

- Fully custom Shopify storefront tailored to brand identity  
- Responsive, user-friendly layouts across all key pages  
- Editable theme with dynamic content blocks for easy updates  
- Fast performance and clean codebase for long-term stability  
- Delivered a scalable foundation for future growth

LEO Eyewear’s online presence now reflects the same attention to detail and clarity as their physical products — simple, sleek, and built to last.
