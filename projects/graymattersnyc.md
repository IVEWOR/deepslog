Gray Matters NYC is a globally recognized fashion brand known for its modern, sculptural footwear made in Italy and sold worldwide. With a strong retail presence in New York and international appeal, they needed a Shopify storefront that matched their artistic design sensibility and could handle complex global requirements — including multi-location support and multi-currency functionality.

I was responsible for building the site from the ground up, using a provided design and transforming it into a fully responsive, pixel-perfect Shopify store. Every section of the site — from homepage to collection and product pages — was developed from scratch using custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid code.

## Objectives

- Build a fully custom Shopify theme from design files with pixel-level accuracy  
- Implement multi-location and multi-currency support for global shoppers  
- Develop dynamic, editable content blocks for flexibility via the Shopify theme editor  
- Create an immersive, clean shopping experience that reflects the brand’s minimalist aesthetic  
- Ensure fast performance, smooth UX, and mobile-first responsiveness across all pages

## Approach

Starting with a blank theme, I implemented the full design using clean, modular code — ensuring every visual element, spacing rule, and animation matched the design vision exactly. All components, from the navigation to the footer, were coded by hand for control and performance.

To give the brand’s internal team the flexibility to manage content without needing to modify code, I built multiple **dynamic theme blocks and sections**, allowing them to edit copy, imagery, and layouts directly from the Shopify customization panel. This included reusable content blocks for homepage, collection highlights, and product storytelling.

I also created **custom theme extensions** and Shopify app blocks for various features — including content layout enhancements, seasonal promotions, and localized messaging — all while maintaining seamless multi-currency and multi-location integration.

## Results

- A pixel-perfect Shopify storefront built entirely from custom code  
- Fully dynamic content blocks for easy editing with no developer required  
- Multi-currency and multi-location functionality for a global customer base  
- Clean, responsive, and immersive frontend matching a high-end brand aesthetic  
- Stable and scalable theme architecture that supports new content, products, and pages

From code to UX, every detail was carefully crafted to support the brand’s high-end image while making life easier for their content team — and it’s still live, working, and selling worldwide.
