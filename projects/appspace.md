Appspace is a U.S.-based enterprise software company that provides workplace experience platforms for some of the world’s biggest organizations. I worked with their team for over nine months, building, maintaining, and scaling their WordPress-powered business website — a core platform for their digital marketing, lead generation, and brand presence.

The site was developed with Elementor, but heavily extended using custom-built plugins and reusable components designed for flexibility, performance, and scale. My role spanned across nearly every page and interaction on the site — from complex landing pages to marketing funnels and interactive quizzes.

## Objectives

- Build and manage critical pages: homepage, pricing, lead gen, about, CTAs, sliders, and more  
- Develop reusable custom Elementor blocks and plugin-based modules  
- Create an interactive quiz system with dynamic redirect logic  
- Extend Elementor’s capabilities without sacrificing performance  
- Ensure content editors had the flexibility to manage layout and content variations without dev support  
- Thoroughly test all builds to ensure quality across devices and browsers

## Approach

Working within the Elementor ecosystem, I developed multiple custom plugins to meet the site's expanding needs. One major build was a **custom quiz plugin**, allowing the marketing team to create their own multi-step quizzes with questions, answer logic, and custom result-based redirections.

Each quiz was fully configurable from the backend, and the scoring system was built with core JavaScript for responsiveness and flexibility. Custom templates handled both the quiz display and the final results page, which dynamically routed users based on their score to a designated destination.

In addition, I created custom Elementor widgets for various complex components:
- **Pricing section plugin** with flexible input options and dynamic display formats  
- **CTA blocks** with animation, button logic, and multi-layout configurations  
- Multiple **section templates** used across the site to standardize design while giving editors drag-and-drop control

All development went through QA cycles and thorough testing to ensure consistency and reliability across browsers and devices.

## Results

- Dozens of new, fully responsive and scalable pages delivered over 9 months  
- Fully integrated **custom quiz system** used for lead generation and engagement  
- Elementor extended with custom plugins tailored for marketing flexibility  
- Significant reduction in bottlenecks for the internal team — no more waiting on devs for small layout tweaks  
- A cohesive, high-performing marketing site aligned with enterprise design and strategy

This was a long-term, high-impact engagement where I touched nearly every aspect of the business site — from interactive experiences to foundational components.
